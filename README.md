# 🚀 Mini Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Mini Projects Repository!  
Here, I share a collection of compact but impactful projects exploring Data Science, Machine Learning, LLMs, MLOps, and more.  
Each project tackles a real-world problem with a focus on **innovation**, **practicality**, and **hands-on learning**.
