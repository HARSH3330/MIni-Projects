You are a data scientist specializing in advanced Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM).
You have been provided with a structured Excel dataset containing weekly-level data with the following types of variables:

Dependent Variable: Weekly sales (e.g., HUE_SALES)

Marketing Channels: Spend, impressions, clicks across search, social, display, promotions, and traditional media

Seasonality & Events: Binary flags for holidays (e.g., Prime Day, Black Friday), seasonal spikes (e.g., Christmas), and promotional periods

External Variables: Inflation rates, pricing indices, discount levels

Time Identifiers: Year, week number, date
{preview}
 
Your Tasks:
ðŸ“ˆ 1. Identify Key Sales Drivers
Determine which variables most strongly influence weekly sales.

Differentiate between incremental marketing impact and baseline sales (sales that would occur without marketing).

ðŸ“Š 2. Calculate Channel Contribution (%)
Break down the sales into:

Baseline Sales

Incremental Sales from each Marketing Channel

Report this as a percentage contribution to total sales for each.

ðŸ’¸ 3. Compute ROI (Return on Investment)
For each channel with associated spend (e.g., search, display, social, offline), calculate ROI using:
ROI = Incremental Sales / Spend

Highlight any underperforming or inefficient channels.

ðŸ“… 4. Detect Seasonality & External Effects
Highlight any time-based patterns or events that consistently lead to sales spikes or drops.

Discuss how inflation or discounts affect overall sales behavior.

ðŸ§  5. Provide Strategic Insights
What are the top 3 most effective marketing levers to focus on?

Which areas should be reduced, paused, or reallocated based on diminishing returns or poor ROI?

ðŸ“Œ 6. Deliver an Executive Summary
Present your insights in a structured, bullet-point summary.

Focus on action-oriented recommendations that a CMO or VP of Marketing could use for media planning and strategy.

# Generate Evaluation Prompt (G-Eval Style) for MMM Analysis
def evaluate_response_gemma(prompt, response):
    eval_template = """
You are an expert evaluator tasked with analyzing the LLM's response.

Prompt:
{prompt}

LLM Response:
{response}

Evaluation Criteria:
Clarity & Structure â€“ Is the output logically organized and easy to follow?

Accuracy â€“ Are the insights grounded in the dataset and supported by quantitative analysis?

Channel Contribution â€“ Are % contributions and baseline breakdowns accurate and clearly presented?

ROI Calculation â€“ Are the ROI metrics correctly computed and meaningfully interpreted?

Strategic Insights â€“ Are the recommendations actionable, relevant, and supported by the data?

Seasonality & External Factors â€“ Is there a meaningful assessment of events, inflation, or promotions?

Executive Readability â€“ Could this report be used in a CMO-level meeting?

Provide a score from 1 to 10 for each of these criteria, followed by a detailed explanation of your reasoning for each score.
